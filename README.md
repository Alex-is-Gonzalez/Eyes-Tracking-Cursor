# Moving Eyes
## Exercise on Eyes Tracking Cursor
<img src= "Eyes.png" width='300'/>

## Description
In order to create eyes on a page HTML tags were used to used to manipulate the appearance on the page. From there, introductory CSS was used to style the page. Lastly, in the JavaScript file, a handle on the ID "ball" was used in order to add functionality to the eyes. 
## Installation 
Download a copy of the Eyes-Tracking-Cursor repo. Drag and drop "eyes.html" onto a blank webpage and load the page. You should see an two eyes interacting with your cursor!

## Usage
This project is an example of having an interactive element on a webpage. This can also show new coders how to seperate and organize their files. In "eyes.html", two other files are linked, the CSS and Javascript. This is the preferred level of organization over the "TwoEyeComboFile" which combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into one file.
